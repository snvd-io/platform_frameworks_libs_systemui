/**
 * Writes a trace message to indicate that a given section of code has begun running __on the
 * current thread__. This must be followed by a corresponding call to [endSlice] in a reasonably
 * short amount of time __on the same thread__ (i.e. _before_ the thread becomes idle again and
 * starts running other, unrelated work).
 *
 * Calls to [beginSlice] and [endSlice] may be nested, and they will render in Perfetto as follows:
 * ```
 * Thread #1 | [==========================]
 *           |       [==============]
 *           |           [====]
 * ```
 *
 * This function is provided for convenience to wrap a call to [Trace.traceBegin], which is more
 * verbose to call than [Trace.beginSection], but has the added benefit of not throwing an
 * [IllegalArgumentException] if the provided string is longer than 127 characters. We use the term
 * "slice" instead of "section" to be consistent with Perfetto.
 *
 * # Avoiding malformed traces
 *
 * Improper usage of this API will lead to malformed traces with long slices that sometimes never
 * end. This will look like the following:
 * ```
 * Thread #1 | [===================================================================== ...
 *           |       [==============]         [====================================== ...
 *           |           [=======]              [======]       [===================== ...
 *           |                                                       [=======]
 * ```
 *
 * To avoid this, [beginSlice] and [endSlice] should never be called from `suspend` blocks (instead,
 * use [traceCoroutine] for tracing suspending functions). While it would be technically okay to
 * call from a suspending function if that function were to only wrap non-suspending blocks with
 * [beginSlice] and [endSlice], doing so is risky because suspend calls could be mistakenly added to
 * that block as the code is refactored.
 *
 * Additionally, it is _not_ okay to call [beginSlice] when registering a callback and match it with
 * a call to [endSlice] inside that callback, even if the callback runs on the same thread. Doing so
 * would cause malformed traces because the [beginSlice] wasn't closed before the thread became idle
 * and started running unrelated work.
 *
 * @param sliceName The name of the code section to appear in the trace
 * @see endSlice
 * @see traceCoroutine
